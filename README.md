### Steps to Add the README.md File:

1. **Create the File**:
   - In your project directory, create a new file named `README.md`.

2. **Add Content**:
   - Copy and paste the above content into the `README.md` file.

3. **Customize**:
   - Replace placeholders (e.g., `your-username`, `screenshot.png`) with actual values.
   - Add a screenshot of your calculator by placing an image file (e.g., `screenshot.png`) in the project directory and updating the path in the `README.md`.

4. **Commit and Push**:
   - Add the `README.md` file to your repository:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README.md file with project details"
     git push origin main
     ```

This `README.md` will provide a clear overview of your project for anyone visiting your GitHub repository.
